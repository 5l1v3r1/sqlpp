Here are some examples of the different features of sql++.

# quickly doing a select on many different values for a WHERE clause
IMPORT - '' SELECT domain, nameserver FROM domains_table WHERE domain = ?;
abc.com
bcd.com
cde.com
samy.pl
CTRL+D


# copying a table into another table using sql++'s subselect
INSERT INTO table1 VALUES(subsel(SELECT * FROM table2));


# copying a table into another table in a completely different
# database, as well as type of database using sql++'s subselect
# plus multiple connections
connect -t oracle -u user -X pass oradb
> Created connection handle '1' to oradb
connect -t mysql -u user -X pass mydb
> Created connection handle '2' to mydb
conn 2 INSERT INTO my_tbl VALUES(subsel(conn 1 SELECT * FROM ora_tbl));


# taking a long row, making a simple modification, and inserting it quickly
# using the overwrite export function, edit function, and import function
oexport x , SELECT * FROM user WHERE user='root';
edit x;
> your editor opens and you make a quick change to
> the comma seperated data and then save and exit
import x , INSERT INTO user VALUES(??);
