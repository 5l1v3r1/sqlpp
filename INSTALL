sql++ Installation

Required modules:
  DBI
  Time::HiRes
  Term::ReadKey
  Term::ReadLine::Gnu on *NIX, Term::ReadLine::Perl on Win32 (this will be installed as 'Term::ReadLine')
 
To install sql++, run:
  perl install.pl

This will check for the required modules.  It will then
tell you what available database drivers you have.

If you are missing any of the required modules, it will attempt
to install them for you if you allow it.  If you wish to install
the modules yourself or install.pl has problems installing them
and requires manual installation, get them from CPAN 
(http://search.cpan.org) and install them.  You can return to
the installation later.
                      
If you wish to use sql++ with other databases that install.pl
did not say you had a driver for, continue with the installation
and you can choose to install any from a larger list it will give you. 

If the database you want to use is not in the list at all,
check http://search.cpan.org for the database name.  If you come
up with a DBD::database_name module, download it and follow the
instructions to install it.
