Display binary columns as hexadecimal encoded.

Add a command to view all connections and connection info.

Add a control sequence and command to switch between database
 connections.

Make the prompts variable (e.g., '$user.$dbname> ').

Make the 'Enter password:' line print to terminal so you can
 pipe data to sql++.

Create a Win32 stand-alone executable with support for common
 database types.

Add using configuration documentation to the `morehelp` function.

POSSIBLY add a calculator (base calculator as well?)

POSSIBLY add optional color support.

Add '??' (variable size place-holders) functionality to macros.

Add a 'Rows matched/changed/warnings' on MySQL UPDATEs.

Possibly some type of userland namespace.  e.g.,
  @rows = SELECT field1, field2 FROM table_name;
  INSERT INTO table2(fielda, fieldb) VALUES(@rows);
Another possibility I was discussing with someone is perl code
 with easily embedded sql.  E.g.,
  eval(
    foreach (@arr = sql(SELECT id, name FROM table))
    {
      sql(DELETE FROM table WHERE id = $arr[0]) if $arr[1] =~ /bad/i;
    }
  );

Add support for running .sql files.  e.g.,
  @file
 or
  sql++ -s file database_name
 or
  source file
 or
  \. file

Test other databases...
